    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    All documentation is available in both english and norwegian. It is recommended that you
    start by reading the file <a href="https://github.com/Amadiro/Skyport-logic/blob/master/docs/en/GAME.md">docs/en/GAME.md</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Amadiro/Skyport-logic/blob/master/docs/no/GAME_NO.md">docs/no/GAME.md</a> for the english and norwegian versions respectively, which describes
    the game rules.
    Incomplete APIs for the protocol for various languages can be found in the api/ folder.
    If you want to get started writing your own API (or in general looking into the protocol), read
    <a href="https://github.com/Amadiro/Skyport-logic/blob/master/docs/en/PROTOCOL.md">docs/en/PROTOCOL.md</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Amadiro/Skyport-logic/blob/master/docs/no/PROTOCOL_NO.md">docs/no/PROTOCOL.md</a> for the english and norwegian versions respectively.

    <h2>Problems with outdated java versions on OSX</h2>
    There is a known problem running the server on OSX, which revolves around OSX having several
    different versions of java installed concurrently. In safari you get the latest java 1.7, but
    on the command-line, `java` invokes a very old java 1.6 version, which does not have the necessary
    feature-set required to run the server. A workaround for this issue will be published here soonish.
